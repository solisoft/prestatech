Scandit SDK Changelog

Changes in ScanditSDK Plugin for Titanium 1.2.2 (iPhone only)

* Replaced old GUID in manifest file with a freshly generated GUID that is now identical
to the GUID in Android manifest file. The code base of the plugin is unchanged from the 1.2.1 release of the module.

Changes in ScanditSDK Plugin for Titanium 1.2.1 (iPhone only)

* changed GUID in manifest file back to the one in version 1.1.1 - change of GUID in combination with change of GUID stored in the appcelerator marketplace caused lots of issues with existing Android users of our plugin. 


Changes in ScanditSDK Plugin for Titanium 1.2.0 (iPhone only - Android will follow later) - May 31th

* incorporates the latest Scandit SDK for iOS (V3.0.2) - see below for detailed changes in Scandit SDK V3.0.2

* updated Ti Plugin API with new methods to use Scandit SDK for iOS 3.0.* functionality. See API documentation for details. 





From the RELEASE NOTES of the Scandit SDK 3.0.* Release for iOS:

What's New in Scandit SDK 3.0.* for iOS

The new Scandit SDK 3.0.* features a number of improvements to the overall scanning 
performance:

   * full screen scanning: In Scandit SDK 2.*, the user had to place the barcode in the
     center of the camera image. In this new release, barcodes are detected and decoded in
     the entire camera image.

   * improved autofocus management: We improved the camera control which means that the
     camera properties (such as focus) are maintained over successive barcode scans. This new
     feature makes a big difference if you are planning on scanning multiple barcodes in 
     sequence.

   * better scan performance and robustness: We further improved our blurry barcode decoding 
     algorithms so that even the very blurry images of an iPhone 5 (before the autofocus is 
     activated) are now decoded. 

   * new cleaner scan screen interface with the option to add a button to switch cameras 
     (from the front to the back camera) 

   * new symbologies: beta support for PDF417 and MSI Plessey. 


Compatibility Concerns

* Access to the methods that are available for scan screen customization has been 
restricted for users of our free Community edition. They remain available for our 
enterprise customers. Moving forward we want apps using our free community 
edition to have a common scan screen user interface that promotes our Scandit brand. 

* The Scandit SDK starts by default in full screen scanning mode. If you want to only scan barcodes 
in a restricted area of the camera image, you should call the "restrictActiveScanningArea" method of 
the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker.

* Scandit SDK 3.0.* requires a new iOS framework: libc++. To add the library, select your 
target in Xcode, choose build phases and add the library under the "Link Binary With Libraries" entry.

* In 3.0.* for iOS, we only support iOS devices with iOS 5.0 and higher. If you need need iOS 4.3 support, 
using Scandit SDK 2.* for iOS and the corresponding Titanium Plugin Version 1.1. 


Known Issues (will be fixed in the next bug fix release):

* Barcodes that are placed at an angle of 45 degrees in the image are currently not detected reliably. 

* The camera image is slightly distorted on iPad 4s (square qr codes do not appear square).

* Highlighted code in the scan UI is slightly off the true position in landscape mode.

* Scanning of vertical barcodes is not working as reliable as horizontal barcodes. 

* Barcode scanning performance with the iPad4 front facing camera is significantly worse 
than on the iPad3 front facing camera. 

* The PDF417 Scanner is still beta - the current version works well with PDF417 that have 
large modules - it struggles as the pdf417 features get smaller.  
 


Changes in ScanditSDK Plugin for Titanium 1.1.1 (Android & iPhone) - February 27th 2013

* fixed critical bug in Android Titanium plugin 1.1.0 where all builds had the enterprise trial feature set which requires mandatory network access.


Changes in ScanditSDK Plugin for Titanium 1.1.0 (Android & iPhone) - February 19th 2013

* Important software update to work with orientation changes and to support barcode scanning in landscape mode. 

IMPORTANT: this update requires a (small) change to the way you instantiate the Scandit SDK in your Titanium app. See the example for details. 

* Fixed a bug in timodule.xml (Android) that prevented deployment on any device. Autofocus and flash are now also optional (no longer required). 

* Fixed a bug where QR code scanning was only enabled by default on iPhone devices and not on Android devices. QR code scanning is now enabled by default on both platforms. 

* Fixed a bug resulting from a typo in the method stopScanning. the method is now called stopScanning (and no longer stopScannning).  

* Corrected toolbar offset.

* Upgraded to Scandit SDK for Android 3.3.0. This includes software updates that address idiosyncrasies of various Android devices (Nexus 4, Nexus 7, â€¦), support for GS1 QR codes, improved scanning performance on a number of Android devices

* Upgraded to Scandit SDK for iPhone 2.2.7. This includes software updates to fix bug when switching from front to back camera by deallocating and reallocating ScanditBarcodePicker, to address a rare bug related to the OpenUDID implementation, to make 'beep' implementation less greedy, support for GS1 QR code symbology,
